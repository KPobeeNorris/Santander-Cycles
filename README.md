### Santander Cycles - Graduation Project ###

#### Intro ####

I am returning to Santander Cycles / Boris Bikes as want to make a return to Ruby and ensure I have a firm grasp of the fundamentals of OOP.  Whilst at Maker's I did not reach the end of the project and know that there were some interesting challenges at the end which I think will be a good test.

#### Project ####

The aim of Santander Cycles is to build up a model example of the system in place e.g. docking stations, bikes, infrastructure and so forth.
